Constantly pitch black
Has Lost Ghosts, adventurers who were taken by the Rogue Ghost. They will wander around and are harmless, unless the player provokes them.
Rogue Ghosts are grotesque abominations that float towards the player. Noteable appendages from these monsters include arms, eyes, and mouths.
When a Rogue Ghost is present, the player will experience hallucinations of strange, shadow figures.
If the player "sees" the Rogue Ghost, they will be transported to a pocket dimension where it will give chase. If the player is caught, they will transform into a Lost Ghost, where they wander the moon forever(basically instant death).
These moons are very rare, having a 1% chance of replacing a normal moon.
The reward for exploring this moon is "Strange Matter", a substance that can be used to create a "beacon" to lure the Great Erchius Specter. It can also be used to create the stronger variants of Lunarite weapons. It is also what provokes the Rogue Ghost, since it also wants Strange Matter(it can only obtain it by stealing it from adventurers)
